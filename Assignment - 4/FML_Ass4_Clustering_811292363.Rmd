# Interpret the clusters with respect to the numerical variables used in forming the clusters. 

### Cluster_1 - AGN, PHA, BAY - These have the highest PE_Ratio. By observing the mean values of all quantitative variables for each cluster, the ROE value is poor.
### Cluster_2 - JNJ, MRK, GSK, and PFE. They have the biggest market capitalization and good leverage value.
### Cluster_3 - AHM, AVE, and WPI. They have the lowest beta and asset turnover.
### Cluster_4 - IVX, MRX, ELN, and CHTT. They exhibit lowest market capitalization, leverage, and beta. They're good and their revenue growth is the highest.
### Cluster_5 - ABT, NVS, AZN, LLY, BMY, WYE, SGP. These companies have the largest net profit margin, the biggest asset turnover, and the lowest sales growth.


# Is there a pattern in the clusters with respect to the numerical variables (10 to 12)? (those not used in forming the clusters)

### For cluster 1: It should be held in accordance with media recommendations as it has the highest PE Ratio.
### For cluster 2: It has a good leverage value and the largest market capitalization. Additionally, they can be rather violent. 
### For cluster 3: Its beta and asset turnover are the lowest. However, media endorsements are very positive.
### For cluster 4: They come with a modest recommendation despite the high leverage ratio.
### For Cluster 5: They have the largest net profit margin, the highest asset turnover and the lowest revenue growth.


# Provide an appropriate name for each cluster using any or all of the variables in the dataset.

### Cluster 1: Hold cluster â€“ Their numbers are respectable.
### Cluster 2: Mild Purchase or Hold cluster.
### Cluster 3: To Purchase or To Sell
### Cluster 4: Purchase Cluster; as it is fairly stable.
### Cluster 5: High Hold Cluster
